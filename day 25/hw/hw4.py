#IMPLICIT CONVERSION:
#when you divide integers in python,the answer in terminal would be
#a float,even if the answer could be an integer.pyhton does this because 
#to make sure the division is accurate.
#thats called implicit conversion.


#EXPLICIT CONVERSION:
#when you want to change one type into another using functions
#for example when you want to change float into intenger
#you have to use int() function.
#that is called explicit conversion.
